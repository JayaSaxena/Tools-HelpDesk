Commands Practiced::
1. git clone <path> 			Creates a clone at this location
2. git checkout -b firstBranch		Creates a new branch locally.. this branch will be visible from github page, only after "push -u origin" command 
   git checkout <branch>		Switch branches or restores working tree files
3. git status
4. git add <file>			To track files; Adds file contents to the index
5. git commit 				Records changes to the repository in the local branch; Changes won't get reflected on github, till not "push"ed.
   git commit -a 			To automatically "add" changes to all tracked files and also to commit them all
   git commit -m "commit message"	To specify commit message
6. git branch				Lists even the local branches
7. git push -u origin <branch>		Pushes a new local branch to a remote Git repository and tracks it too
   git push 				Publishes your local commits; With this, we can view the changes on github website.
8. git diff				To view the changes yet to be staged... "add" command, if used, will stage these changes.
